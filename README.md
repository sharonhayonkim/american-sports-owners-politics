Political Donations By American Sports Owners

This dataset contains every confirmed partisan political contribution from team owners and commissioners in the NFL, NBA, WNBA, NHL, MLB, and NASCAR. Only contributions while owners were involved with the team are included. The data is from the Federal Election Commission and OpenSecrets.

I use SQL to analyze the dataset and answer the following 5 questions: 
1. which party got more donations - democrats or republicans?
2. which organization or cause received the most donation? 
3. to which party did each league give most to? 
4. who gave the biggest one-time donation?
5. who gave the most in total?
